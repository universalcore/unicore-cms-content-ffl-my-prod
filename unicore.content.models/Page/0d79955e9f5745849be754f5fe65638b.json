This\r\n   helps to stimulate a child\u2019s social and emotional growth and\r\n   development.\r\n\r\n - When feeding, children should be encouraged to eat. Do not force-feed\r\n   them.\r\n\r\n - If a child refuses to eat a variety of foods, experiment with\r\n   different food combinations, tastes, textures and methods of\r\n   encouragement.\r\n\r\n - Minimise distractions during meals if the child loses interest\r\n   easily.\r\n\r\n - Infants need to be fed directly. Young children can be assisted when\r\n   they are learning to eat themselves.\r\n\r\n - Both mothers and fathers must be responsible for their child\u2019s\r\n   nutrition. Both parents should take part in feeding their daughters\r\n   and sons.\r\n\r\n",
