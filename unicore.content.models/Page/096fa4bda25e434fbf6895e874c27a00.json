Vector diagrams depict a vector by use of an arrow drawn to scale in a specific direction. You have seen vector diagrams previously in the lesson about free-body diagrams-- feel free to review that module before going on. An example of a scaled vector diagram is shown in the diagram above. The vector diagram depicts a displacement vector. Observe that there are several characteristics of this diagram that make it an appropriately drawn vector diagram.\r\n\r\n - a scale is clearly listed\r\n - a vector arrow (with arrowhead) is drawn in a specified direction. The vector arrow has a head and a tail.\r\n - the magnitude and direction of the vector is clearly labeled. In this case, the diagram shows the magnitude is 20 m and the direction is (30 degrees West of North).\r\n\r\n![vectors have a head and tail](http://thumbor.unicore.io/GTrjCQfJWrQUOVJ3HkTA9XrTEBk=/9dccc12d2c074894b661615523a7cf8e)",
