Even if a woman was immunised earlier, she needs to seek advice from a health worker on tetanus toxoid immunisation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is safe for a pregnant woman to be immunised against tetanus according to this schedule:\r\n\r\n\r\n - **First dose:**\tAs soon as she knows she is pregnant.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n - **Second dose:** One month after the first dose, and no later than two\r\n   weeks before her due date.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n - **Third dose:** Six months to one year after the second dose, or during\r\n   the next pregnancy.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n - **Fourth dose:** One year after the third dose, or during a subsequent\r\n   pregnancy.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n - **Fifth dose:**\tOne year after the fourth dose, or during a subsequent\r\n   pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter five properly spaced doses, the mother is protected for life and her children are protected for the first few weeks of life.",
