Even if a woman was immunised earlier, she needs to seek\r\n   advice from a health worker on tetanus toxoid immunisation.\r\n\r\n - It is safe for a pregnant woman to be immunised against tetanus\r\n   according to this schedule:\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. First dose: As soon as she knows she is pregnant.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 2. Second dose: One month after the first dose, and no later than two weeks before her due date. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 3. Third dose: Six months to one year after the second dose, or during the next pregnancy. \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 4. Fourth dose: One year after the third dose, or during a subsequent pregnancy.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 5. Fifth dose: One year after the fourth dose, or during a subsequent pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter five properly spaced doses, the mother is protected for life and her children are protected for the first few weeks of life.",
