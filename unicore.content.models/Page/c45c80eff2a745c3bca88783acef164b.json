The more the watery stools, the more dangerous the diarrhoea. \r\n\r\nDiarrhoea kills children by draining liquid from the body, which dehydrates the child. A child who has the following signs may have diarrhea or cholera. \r\n\r\n- passes several watery stools in an hour\r\n- passes blood in the stool\r\n- vomits frequently\r\n- has a fever\r\n- is extremely thirsty\r\n- does not want to drink and/or refuses to eat\r\n- has sunken eyes\r\n- looks weak or is lethargic\r\n- has diarrhoea for several days\r\n\r\nParents should **immediately** seek help from a trained health worker.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the child should be given ORS solution and/or other liquids, plus zinc.\r\n",
