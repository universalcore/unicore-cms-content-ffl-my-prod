  "content": " - Many parents do not take a child to be immunised because the child\r\n   has a fever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However,\r\n   it is safe to immunise a child who has a minor illness.\r\n\r\n - It is also safe to immunise a child who has a disability or is\r\n   malnourished.\r\n\r\n - If a child is HIV-positive or suspected to be HIV-positive, a trained\r\n   health worker should be consulted about which vaccines to give the\r\n   child.\r\n\r\n - After an injection, the child may cry or develop a fever, a minor\r\n   rash or a small sore. This is normal and shows that the vaccine is\r\n   working. Children under 6 months of age should breastfeed frequently;\r\n   older children should be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the\r\n   child develops a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius) the child\r\n   should be taken to a trained health worker or health centre.\r\n\r\n - Measles can be extremely dangerous for malnourished children, so they\r\n   should be immunised against measles, especially if the malnutrition\r\n   is severe.\r\n\r\n",
