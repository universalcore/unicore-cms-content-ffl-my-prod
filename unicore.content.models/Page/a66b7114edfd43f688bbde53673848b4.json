  "content": "Many parents do not take a child to be immunised because the child has a fever, cough, cold, diarrhoea or some other illness. However, it is safe to immunise a child who has a minor illness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also safe to immunise a child who has a disability or is malnourished. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf a child is HIV-positive or suspected to be HIV-positive, a trained health worker should be consulted about which vaccines to give the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an injection, the child may cry or develop a fever, a minor rash or a small sore. This is normal and shows that the vaccine is working. Children under 6 months of age should breastfeed frequently; older children should be given plenty of liquids and foods. If the child develops a high fever (over 38 degrees Celsius) the child should be taken to a trained health worker or health centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nMeasles can be extremely dangerous for malnourished children, so they should be immunised against measles, especially if the malnutrition is severe.\r\n",
