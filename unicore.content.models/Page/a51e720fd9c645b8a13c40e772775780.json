  "content": "If a mother cannot be with her baby during working hours, she should breastfeed often when they are together. With frequent breastfeeding, she will continue to produce breastmilk.\r\n\r\nIf a woman cannot breastfeed at her workplace, she can express her milk 2 or 3 times during the workday and refrigerate it or store it at room temperature for up to eight hours in a clean, covered container. The expressed milk can be given to the child by another caregiver from a clean cup.\r\n\r\nFamilies and communities can encourage employers to provide paid maternity leave, cr\u00e8ches, and the time and a suitable place for women to breastfeed or express and store their milk. The place should be clean, safe and private. It should have clean water available for washing hands and utensils.\r\n",
