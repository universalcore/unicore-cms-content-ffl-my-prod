These must be mashed, minced or cut\r\n   into very small pieces.\r\n\r\n - Start with 2\u20133 spoonfuls per feeding, increasing gradually to 1/2 of\r\n   a 250-millilitre cup.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**9\u201324 months:**\r\n\r\n - Children should receive other foods 3-4 times a day in addition to\r\n   breastfeeding.\r\n\r\n - Give infants aged 9\u201311 months 1/2 of a 250-millilitre cup per\r\n   feeding.\r\n\r\n - Provide children aged 12\u201323 months 3/4 to 1 whole 250-millilitre cup\r\n   per feeding.\r\n\r\n - Give children 2 years and older at least 1 whole 250-millilitre cup\r\n   per feeding.  Meat, fish and eggs, should be included as much as\r\n   possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**By 12 months:**\r\n\r\n - Most children can eat 'family foods' of a solid consistency.\r\n   Semi-solid foods can still be given as it is easier for young\r\n   children to eat.\r\n\r\n - Nutritious snacks such as fruit, bread or bread with nut paste can be\r\n   given 1-2 times a day, as desired, starting at 6 months.\r\n\r\n - If the quality or amount of food per meal is low, or the child is no\r\n   longer breastfeeding, give 1\u20132 cups of milk and 1-2 extra meals each\r\n   day.\r\n\r\n",
