Children should be immunised at the recommended\r\n   ages and should receive subsequent doses at recommended intervals.\r\n\r\n - When a child is immunised, the health worker should record the\r\n   vaccine, which dose it is (first, second, etc.) and the date on an\r\n   immunisation or health card given to the parents or other caregiver.\r\n   The immunisations should also be recorded and kept at the health\r\n   clinic.\r\n\r\n - It is important for the parents or other caregiver to keep the\r\n   immunisation card and bring it with them the next time the child is\r\n   vaccinated. With it, the health worker can record which vaccines the\r\n   child has received and the date they were given.\r\n\r\n - The health worker can also provide information to the parents or\r\n   other caregiver on vaccines that are missing or remaining.\r\n\r\n",
