No other milks contain these antibodies.\r\n\r\n - Breastmilk is a baby's 'first immunization'. It helps to protect\r\n   against diarrhoea, ear and chest infections, and other health\r\n   problems.\r\n\r\n - The protection is greatest when breastmilk alone is given for the\r\n   first 6 months and when breastfeeding continues along with other\r\n   foods well into the second year and beyond.\r\n\r\n - No other milks, foods or supplements can provide the protection of\r\n   breastmilk.\r\n\r\n",
