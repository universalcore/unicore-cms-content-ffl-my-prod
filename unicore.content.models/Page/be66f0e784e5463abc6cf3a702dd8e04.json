  "content": " - A mother's breasts make as much milk as the baby wants. If the baby\r\n   suckles more, more milk is produced.\r\n\r\n - The mother will produce more milk if she does not give the child\r\n   other food or liquids and if she breastfeeds often.\r\n\r\n - Holding the baby in a good position makes it easier for the baby to\r\n   take the breast well into the mouth and suckle. A baby should feed as\r\n   often and for as long as she or he wants.\r\n\r\n - Pacifiers, dummies or bottles should be avoided as a baby may suckle\r\n   less at the breast, which reduces milk production.\r\n\r\n - All mothers need encouragement and support, especially from the\r\n   child's father and their families, to breastfeed their baby\r\n   exclusively for 6 months.\r\n\r\n - A mother who has undergone a Caesarean birth may require extra help\r\n   to begin breastfeeding her baby.\r\n\r\n",
