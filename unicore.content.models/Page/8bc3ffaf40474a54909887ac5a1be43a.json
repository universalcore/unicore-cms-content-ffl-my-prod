  "content": " - When children are sick, such as when they have diarrhoea, measles or\r\n   pneumonia, their appetite decreases and their body uses food less\r\n   effectively. If the child is sick several times a year, his or her\r\n   growth will slow or stop.\r\n\r\n - During an illness, children need additional fluids and encouragement\r\n   to eat regular meals, and breastfeeding infants need to breastfeed\r\n   more often.\r\n\r\n - After an illness, children need to be offered more food than usual to\r\n   replenish the energy and nourishment lost due to the illness.\r\n\r\n - The parent or other caregiver should keep offering foods the child\r\n   likes, a little at a time and as often as possible. Extra\r\n   breastfeeding is especially important since it can provide nutrients\r\n   required for recovery from infections.\r\n\r\n - It is also essential to encourage a sick child to drink plenty of\r\n   liquids to prevent dehydration. When a child has diarrhoea, giving\r\n   him or her oral rehydration salts (ORS) dissolved in clean water,\r\n   along with foods and liquids, can help prevent dehydration. Giving\r\n   the child a zinc supplement every day for 10\u201314 days can reduce the\r\n   severity of the diarrhoea. The child is not fully recovered from an\r\n   illness until he or she weighs about as much as when the illness\r\n   began.\r\n\r\n - If diarrhoea and poor appetite persist for more than a few days, the\r\n   child must be taken to a trained health worker.\r\n\r\n",
