The following vector addition diagram is an example of such a situation. Observe that the angle within the triangle is determined to be 26.6 degrees using SOH CAH TOA. This angle is the southward angle of rotation that the vector R makes with respect to West. Yet the direction of the vector as expressed with the CCW (counterclockwise from East) convention is 206.6 degrees.\r\n\r\n![Angle may not be direction depending on the horizontal](http://thumbor.unicore.io/gRaPmQ36bPUCSomDr5oohwXeBE8=/c1b18adf93a549b591218a006cf2a5a9)",
