  "content": " - The best food for a baby who cannot be breastfed directly is milk\r\n   expressed from the mother's breast, given from a clean, open cup.\r\n\r\n - Cup feeding is safer than bottle feeding because the cup can be\r\n   easily cleaned with soap and water. \r\n\r\n - Cup feeding also provides some of the contact and stimulation the   \r\n   baby needs, since the person has to hold the baby.\r\n\r\n - Feeding with a cup does not cause problems with suckling at the\r\n   breast.\r\n\r\n - Even newborn babies can be fed with an open cup. If it is necessary\r\n   to feed a baby with a nutritionally adequate breastmilk substitute,\r\n   it should be fed to the baby by cup.\r\n\r\n",
